## Goals

- `variant` and (submitted) `query` are reflected in the url (want bookmarkability). they're updated via form fields.
- any update to `query` does not update the url. only when it is submitted will it make the api and reflect in the URL
- any update `variant` updated in the URL, but it is purely UI state to display a particular sprite
